# Railway Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Headless Telegram Client on Railway using the simplified approach.

## Prerequisites

**No special prerequisites needed!** The deployment is now completely self-contained.

- Railway Account: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- GitHub Account: Connect your GitHub account to Railway

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose this repository

### Step 2: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile
2. The build will start automatically
3. **No environment variables needed!**
4. Build time: 2-3 minutes (much faster than before)

### Step 3: Access Your Application

1. Once deployed, Railway will provide a public URL
2. Visit the URL to access the web interface
3. Enter your Telegram API credentials to start using the client

## What Changed

### Before (Complex)
- Required GitHub Personal Access Token
- Built TDLib from source (10-15 minutes)
- Complex build process with authentication issues
- Required build environment variables

### After (Simple)
- No tokens or authentication needed
- Uses pre-compiled TDLib binaries (2-3 minutes)
- Self-contained build process
- Zero configuration required

## Build Process

The new Dockerfile:
1. Starts with Python 3.11 slim image
2. Installs minimal system packages (just wget)
3. Copies your application code
4. Installs Python dependencies (including tdjson with pre-compiled TDLib)
5. Runs your application

## Troubleshooting

### Build Still Fails

If you encounter any build issues:

1. **Check Railway logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify requirements.txt**: Ensure `tdjson>=1.8.0` is included
3. **Check Dockerfile**: Should match the simplified version

### App Won't Start

1. **Check start.sh**: Ensure the script exists and is executable
2. **Verify Python dependencies**: All packages should install correctly
3. **Check Railway runtime logs**: Look for Python errors

### TDLib Not Found

If you get TDLib-related errors:
1. The `tdjson` package should provide all necessary TDLib binaries
2. No additional configuration should be needed
3. Check that `tdjson>=1.8.0` is in requirements.txt

## Performance

### Build Time
- **Before**: 10-15 minutes (compiling TDLib from source)
- **After**: 2-3 minutes (using pre-compiled binaries)

### Reliability
- **Before**: Could fail due to GitHub authentication issues
- **After**: Self-contained, no external dependencies during build

### Maintenance
- **Before**: Required managing GitHub tokens and build environment
- **After**: Zero configuration, deploy and go

## Security Notes

- No GitHub tokens needed
- No build secrets required
- Standard Railway security applies
- Your Telegram API credentials are entered at runtime, not build time

## Alternative Approaches

If you still prefer building TDLib from source (not recommended for Railway):
1. You would need to set up GitHub authentication
2. Build times would be much longer
3. More potential points of failure

The pre-compiled approach is recommended for production deployments.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Railway build and runtime logs
2. Verify your Dockerfile matches the simplified version
3. Ensure `tdjson` is in your requirements.txt
4. Railway has excellent documentation and support

The deployment should now be straightforward and reliable!
