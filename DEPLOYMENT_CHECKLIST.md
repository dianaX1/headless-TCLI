# Railway Deployment Checklist (Simplified)

Use this checklist to ensure successful deployment of your Headless Telegram Client on Railway.

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### ✅ Railway Account Setup
- [ ] Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Connect your GitHub account
- [ ] Verify you can access your repositories

**No GitHub tokens needed!** The build is now completely self-contained.

## Deployment Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Create Railway Project
- [ ] Click "New Project" in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- [ ] Choose your telegram client repository
- [ ] Wait for initial project creation

### ✅ Step 2: Automatic Deployment
- [ ] Railway automatically detects the Dockerfile
- [ ] Build starts automatically (no configuration needed)
- [ ] Wait for build completion (2-3 minutes)

**No environment variables needed!** The deployment is zero-configuration.

## Build Verification

### ✅ Check Build Logs
Look for these success indicators in the build logs:

- [ ] `FROM python:3.11-slim` (confirms correct base image)
- [ ] `Installing collected packages: tdjson...` (confirms TDLib installation)
- [ ] `Successfully built` (confirms Docker build completion)
- [ ] No authentication errors or GitHub-related issues

### ✅ Expected Build Time
- [ ] Build time: 2-3 minutes (much faster than before!)
- [ ] No more 10-15 minute TDLib compilation
- [ ] Consistent build times across deployments

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Application Access
- [ ] Railway provides a public URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
- [ ] Visit the URL in your browser
- [ ] Verify the web interface loads correctly
- [ ] Check for any runtime errors in Railway logs

### ✅ Telegram Client Setup
- [ ] Enter your Telegram API ID and Hash in the web interface
- [ ] Complete phone number verification
- [ ] Test sending a message to verify functionality

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Build Fails
**Most common issues and solutions:**

**Error:** Build fails during pip install
- [ ] Verify `tdjson>=1.8.0` is in requirements.txt
- [ ] Check Railway build logs for specific pip errors
- [ ] Ensure requirements.txt is properly formatted

**Error:** Dockerfile not found
- [ ] Verify Dockerfile exists in repository root
- [ ] Check that Dockerfile has correct content (simplified version)
- [ ] Ensure file is named exactly "Dockerfile" (no extension)

### ❌ App Won't Start
**Symptoms:** Build completes but app shows startup errors

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Check that `start.sh` exists and is executable
- [ ] Verify Railway runtime logs for Python errors
- [ ] Ensure all Python dependencies installed correctly

### ❌ TDLib Not Working
**Symptoms:** App starts but TDLib functionality fails

**Solutions:**
- [ ] Verify `tdjson` package installed (check build logs)
- [ ] Check that no custom TDLib paths are hardcoded
- [ ] Ensure application uses tdjson package correctly

## What's Different (Simplified Approach)

### ✅ No Longer Needed
- [ ] ~~GitHub Personal Access Token~~
- [ ] ~~Build environment variables~~
- [ ] ~~Complex authentication setup~~
- [ ] ~~Long build times (10-15 minutes)~~
- [ ] ~~TDLib compilation from source~~

### ✅ Now Included
- [ ] Pre-compiled TDLib binaries via `tdjson` package
- [ ] Fast 2-3 minute builds
- [ ] Zero-configuration deployment
- [ ] Self-contained build process
- [ ] Reliable, consistent deployments

## Success Criteria

✅ **Deployment is successful when:**
- [ ] Build completes in 2-3 minutes without errors
- [ ] Application is accessible via Railway URL
- [ ] Web interface loads and accepts Telegram credentials
- [ ] You can send and receive messages through the interface
- [ ] No GitHub authentication or build errors occur

## Performance Expectations

### Build Performance
- [ ] **Build time**: 2-3 minutes (vs 10-15 minutes before)
- [ ] **Success rate**: Near 100% (no authentication issues)
- [ ] **Consistency**: Same build time every deployment

### Runtime Performance
- [ ] **Startup time**: Under 30 seconds
- [ ] **Memory usage**: Optimized with slim Python image
- [ ] **Reliability**: Stable pre-compiled TDLib binaries
